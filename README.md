# Zoom-Poll-Analyzer
It was made by a group of six, for the CSE3063 Object Oriented Software Design course. It takes:
* The list of the students who enrolled the course
* Information about all the polls made across the semester, which are:
  * Questions of the polls
  * Answers of the students
  * Answer keys   

as input and produces various statistics according to them.   

The produced statistics are:
* Attendance of the students
* A seperate document for each poll that shows the results of the students on that poll
* A seperate document for each student-poll pair that shows the result of the student on that poll
* A global document that shows the results of the students on all the polls and their total points
